# Usage üë©üèæ‚Äçüî¨
To use expand and collapse feature you need to drag and drop the `UtilHelper` folder in your project 

## Collapse and Expandable for List Usage
To display collapse and expandable in list, follow these steps:
Only you need to prepare data model in `ExpandableHelperModel` file.
Just add your data to dummyListData array and inside `CollapseExpandView` pass your expandable data and give title:

```swift
var dummyListData: [listModel] = [
    listModel(id: 1, expandView: AnyView( CollapseExpandView(expandableData: expandableData, buttonTitle: "Comment"))),
    listModel(id: 2, expandView: AnyView( CollapseExpandView(expandableData: dummyExpandData, buttonTitle: "PostFeed"))),
]

```

Open `ContentView` file

```swift

VStack{
    ForEach(dummyListData) { data in
        data.expandView
    }
}

```

## Collapse and Expandable for Specific View Usage
To display collapse and expandable to specific view, follow these steps:
Just pass the `CollapseExpandView` view component anywhere you want to pass in view and for parameters pass your expandable data and button title

Open `ContentView` file
```swift

VStack{
    CollapseExpandView(expandableData: expandableData, buttonTitle: "custom View")
}

```
